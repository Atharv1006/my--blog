    <h1>We as the Ryan International Group have widespread interest in the sphere of quality education with a commitment to excellence. Our first school in Mumbai that was started in 1976 has grown and branched over a span of 43 years.

        We have grown into one of India's leading group of institutions, providing academic excellence to our students. This is facilitated by dedicated educators who are trained to channelize their energy and resources towards child-centered qualitative learning. We have also ventured into International boundaries by establishing friendship institutions all across the globe.

        We owe the group's success to Almighty God and our dedicated Management team developed by our Founder Chairman Dr. Augustine F. Pinto, ably supported by the Managing Director Madam Grace Pinto.

        Today, the Group Management has evolved into a cohesive and well-knit network of academicians, researchers and professionals.
